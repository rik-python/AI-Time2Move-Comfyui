# AI-Time2Move-Comfyui
Official 'Comfy Compositing' workflow for Wan 2.2 Animate + Time-To-Move (TTM). This pipeline replaces random AI motion with deterministic control. Use drawn trajectories or Nuke blocking animations to direct precise movements for VFX shots (vehicles, characters, fire). Includes the full optimized node graph for physics-aware AI rendering.
